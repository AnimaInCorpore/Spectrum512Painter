# Spectrum512Painter - Agent Guidelines

## Project Purpose
This project is a painting program for the **Spectrum512 Atari ST image format**.

## Core Technical Constraints
- Use **HTML5/WebGL** technology only.
- Use **no external dependencies** (no third-party libraries, frameworks, or CDNs).
- Keep the implementation self-contained in this repository.

## UI/UX Direction
- The website shall mimic an **ancient Atari GEM-like GUI**.
- Use **proper GEM-style English text** for all visible GUI labels, menus, and captions.
- Favor classic windowed desktop styling:
  - flat grayscale panels,
  - beveled borders,
  - pixel-like iconography,
  - retro menu/toolbox layout,
  - minimal modern visual effects.
- Prioritize usability for pixel-art / retro paint workflows while preserving the GEM aesthetic.
